Description: fast lookup of country codes from IP addresses
 Finding the home country of a client using only the IP address can be 
 difficult. Looking up the domain name associated with that address can provide 
 some help, but many IP address are not reverse mapped to any useful domain,
 and the most common domain (.com) offers no help when looking for country.
 .
 This module comes bundled with a database of countries where various IP 
 addresses have been assigned.  Although the country of assignment will 
 probably be the country associated with a large ISP rather than the client 
 herself, this is probably good enough for most log analysis applications,
 and under test has proved to be as accurate as reverse-DNS and WHOIS lookup.
