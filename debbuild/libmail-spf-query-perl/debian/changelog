libmail-spf-query-perl (1.999.1) unstable; urgency=low

  Debian:
  * Added watch file.

  Mail::SPF::Query:
  * Do not use \p{} named properties in the "a" and "mx" mechanisms' argument
    validation code, since Perl 5.6 requires (flaky) "use utf8" for them to
    work, and [a-z]/[a-z0-9] should work just as well (closes rt.cpan.org bug
    #17815).
  * Some minor documentation formatting improvements.

libmail-spf-query-perl (1.999) unstable; urgency=low

  Debian:
  * Build-Depend, not Build-Depend-Indep, on debhelper.  Also, depend on
    debhelper >= 5.
  * Build-Depend-Indep on netbase to allow testing to work when building in a
    pbuilder chroot (closes: #351030).

  Mail::SPF::Query:
  * No longer accept malformed SPF records such as "\"v=spf1 ...\"" (spurious
    double quotes) or " v=spf1 ..." (leading whitespace).
  * Combine multiple TXT strings into a single string _before_ fallbacks are
    tried.  Thus, fallbacks now also get applied if there are only non-
    "v=spf1" TXT records; this wasn't the case before.
  * Guard against non-numeric cidr-lengths (closes rt.cpan.org bug #17061).
  * Flattened the { 'domain' => { record => '...' } } override and fallback
    argument format to just { 'domain' => '...' }.  The old format is still
    supported for backwards compatibility.
  * Added a "BUGS" section to the man-page documenting M:S:Q's known
    deficiencies.
  * Lots of minor code improvements.

  spfquery:
  * Correctly recognize the --mail-from (AKA --sender) option.  The version
    in the M:S:Q 1.998 release was broken in this regard.
  * Actually require the --helo option for the --mail-from (AKA --sender)
    form.
  * Cleaned up command-line argument validation code.
  * Cleaned up the inconsistent short and long (--help) usage and man-page
    texts.
  * Clarified the file input syntax in the help and man-page texts.
  * The "--override" and "--fallback" options are now actually working and
    documented.

  Tests:
  * Overhauled 00_all.t test script:
    * Don't skip tests when a non-last test in a test tuple fails (this made
      test 223 "fail", for example, because Test::Harness thought that some
      planned tests were not performed).
    * Marked test 219 (SERVFAIL) as non-critical, because it isn't completely
      reliable (sometimes, apparently behind some NATs and firewalls, the
      query just times out instead of returning SERVFAIL) (closes rt.cpan.org
      bug #17099).
    * Generate and collect debug log output (internally) along with the normal
      M:S:Q->result() calls right away, so that extra just-to-get-debug-output
      M:S:Q->result() calls can be saved.  Also we can make debug log output
      Test::Harness-compatible this way by printing it ourselves with '#'
      chars at the beginnings of lines.
    * Cleaned up code.
  * Cleaned up comments in t/test.dat test data file.

libmail-spf-query-perl (1.998) unstable; urgency=low

  Debian:
  * New maintainer: Julian Mehnle <julian@mehnle.net>.
  * Unversioned Build-Depends and Depends on liburi-perl.
  * Updated package description.
  * Cleaned up debian/rules.
  * Updated copyright file to reflect new Debian and upstream maintainership.
  * spfquery man-page has been included (and updated) upstream.

  Mail::SPF::Query:
  * Removed obsolete Caller-ID support (closes: #337319, #337500).
  * Always use Sys::Hostname::Long. And thus, depend on libsys-hostname-long
    (closes: #332952, #342629).
  * Changed local machine hostname macro from "xr" to "r" (closes rt.cpan.org
    bug #9744).
  * Restrict the number of SPF record lookups to a maximum of 10 (was: 20).
    Thanks to Craig Whitmore!
  * Fixes to mechanisms implementation:
    * a, mx: Check if domain is a valid FQDN, i.e. ends in ".<toplabel>".
    * ip4: Return "unknown" (PermError) if no argument was specified. Also,
      don't auto-complete "1.2.3" CIDR specs to "1.2.3.0", as such an
      abbreviated syntax is forbidden by the SPF spec anyway.
    Thanks to Craig Whitmore!
  * Lots of minor code and documentation fixes/improvements.

  spfd:
  * Added complete POD documentation/man-page.
  * Both "--xxx" and "-xxx" forms of command-line options are now supported.
  * Renamed most of the command-line options:
      --path       => --socket
      --pathuser   => --socket-user
      --pathgroup  => --socket-group
      --pathmode   => --socket-perms
      --setuser    => --set-user
      --setgroup   => --set-group
    The old option names are still supported for backwards compatibility.
  * Do not print usage information when neither "--port" nor "--socket" are
    specified (i.e. when the default TCP port would just be used).  Print a
    more specific hint instead.
  * Added "--help" option to print usage information.
  * Some minor code fixes/improvements.

  spfquery:
  * Added complete POD documentation/man-page.
  * Both "--xxx" and "-xxx" forms of command-line options are now supported.
    Also, a "-x" (short) form is now supported for the most important options.
  * Renamed the "--max-lookup" option to "--max-lookup-count" to match the
    Mail::SPF::Query API.  "--max-lookup" is still supported for backwards
    compatibility.
  * Added "--mail-from" and "-m" synonyms for the "--sender" option for
    consistency with the "--helo" option.
  * Cleaned up the "--help" usage output.
  * Lots of minor code improvements.

  Tests:
  * Some minor tests improvements.
  * Turned test.pl into .t file in t/ directory, so testing output is parsed
    (closes rt.cpan.org bug #7748).
  * Plan the correct number of tests, not just the number of non-comment lines
    in test data file.

  Miscellaneous:
  * Updated URLs everywhere:
      http://spf.pobox.com                           -> http://www.openspf.org
      http://www.anarres.org/projects/srs/           -> http://www.libsrs2.org
      http://asarian-host.net/srs/sendmailsrs.htm
                                  -> http://srs-socketmap.info/sendmailsrs.htm
  * Point out everywhere the "non-standard"-ness of best guess processing,
    trusted forwarder accreditation checking, and several other features.
  * Cleaned up source package file and directory layout:
      Query.pm     -> lib/Mail/SPF/Query.pm
      Changes      -> CHANGES
      test.*       -> t/
      spf{d,query} -> bin/
      sample/      -> examples/
  * postfix-policyd-spf:
    * Generate "Received-SPF:" header unless rejecting (fail/Fail) or deferring
      (error/TempError) the message.
    * Verbose mode is disabled by default.
    Thanks to Arjen de Korte!
  * spf.py: Removed, because it was really old, and this is a Perl package, not
    a Python one.
  * Did I mention lots of minor code and documentation fixes/improvements?
